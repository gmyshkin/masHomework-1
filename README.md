Homework 1 with the overleaf and git assignments
This repository is for Homework 1 of the Modelin and Simulation Class. This repo contains a to do list that was created for part 3 of the assignment. The part 2 assignment was completed by doing the assigned tutorials for git and a screenshot for evidence was produced. The first part of the assignment is connected with overleaf and has things such as EPS images and new chapters for the EPS images and Git assignments.
